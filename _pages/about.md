I'm a third year undergraduate student at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), majoring in [computer science](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/). Before transfering to UW-Madison, I was a computer science undergraduate at [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/). Currently, I'm a member of the [People and Robots Laboratory](https://peopleandrobots.wisc.edu/), advised by professor [Bilge Mutlu](https://bmutlu.github.io/). My research interest is building efficient planning and optimization algorithms for robot motion.
