I'm a third year undergraduate student at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), majoring in [computer science](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/). Before transfering to UW-Madison, I was a computer science undergraduate at [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/). Currently, I'm a member of the [People and Robots Laboratory](https://peopleandrobots.wisc.edu/), advised by professor [Bilge Mutlu](https://bmutlu.github.io/). I'm also an undergrad researcher at [HAND ERC](https://hand-erc.org/).

I am passionate about robotics, especially human-robot interaction and machine learning. My current research focuses on developing bimanual and multi-finger teleoperation systems that integrate virtual reality with advanced robot control, aiming to bridge human dexterity and robotic autonomy through shared control and machine learning.

    <p style="font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.5;">
      We propose a novel teleoperation framework designed to reduce the cognitive load of controlling dual-arm robots equipped with dexterous hands. We built a Recurrent Neural Network that performs real-time classification of user intent on two levels: bimanual coordination modes (e.g., symmetric vs. decoupled motion) and dexterous manipulation types (e.g., precision vs. power grasp). These inferred intentions drive an adaptive shared controller that dynamically adjusts joint constraints, enabling precise and fluid dexterous manipulation in VR.
