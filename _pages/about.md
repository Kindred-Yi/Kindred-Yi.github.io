I'm a third year undergraduate student at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), majoring in [computer science](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/). Before transfering to UW-Madison, I was a computer science undergraduate at [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/). Currently, I'm a member of the [People and Robots Laboratory](https://peopleandrobots.wisc.edu/), advised by professor [Bilge Mutlu](https://bmutlu.github.io/). I'm also an undergrad researcher at [HAND ERC](https://hand-erc.org/).
I am passionate about robotics, especially human-robot interaction and machine learning. My current research focuses on developing bimanual and multi-finger teleoperation systems that integrate virtual reality with advanced robot control, aiming to bridge human dexterity and robotic autonomy through shared control and machine learning.
