I'm a third year undergraduate student at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), majoring in [computer science](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/). Before transfering to UW-Madison, I was a computer science undergraduate at [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes robotics and optimization. This summer I joined [Informatics Skunkworks](https://skunkworks.engr.wisc.edu/), which is a group dedicated to use machine learning models and tools in applied research projects. Recently I'm looking for research opportunities in these topics.

You can find my CV [here](../assets/CV.pdf).
